#Hi guys in this file I will tell you how you can print basic information in the screen and what are comment

#Comments :  These are the lines in one's code that python ignore and are only for user convinience 
#To make a line comment just add "#" in front of it or if you want to make a multiline comment add """ before and after comment

#Print function :  This function helps you to display something on screen

#Diplaying any sentence ----Syntax------> print ("Your sentence here"), for example
print("Hello World")

#It is not neccesary that you only print a sentence you can also print a number, for example
print("6")
print(9)

#Here both 6 and 9 work but they are treated differently 6 is treated as in a sentence and 9 as a number
#You can also use print function to do calculations, for example
print("Two plus two gives : ")
print(2+2)

#Note: Here line#17 was only used for astestics
