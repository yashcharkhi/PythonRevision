# PythonRevision

print ("hello world")

Hi i am Yash Sharma, here I am gonna make python notes which you can see and learn throught these will help you both revise and learn python
Just enjoy and learn coding 

We are gonna use python 3.8 for the job

So if you dont have python i will recommned you to go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download python, I will recommend installing python 3.8 but any version of python3 will do

After that you must have and IDE (Integrated Developement Environment); just a software where you will code. Python provides you with IDLE where you can code but i will recommend donwloading pycharm (see this tutorial by CodeWithHarry if you feel any trouble : https://www.codewithharry.com/videos/python-tutorials-for-absolute-beginners-2)

Note: Most of the files are runable python files
